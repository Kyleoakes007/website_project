    <p>Welcome to Fae Folk Florists we sell locally sourced flowers from farmers whose entire farm is used to grow these beautiful flowers. We only source high quality flowers that have been raised the way nature intended. Our farmers are not allowed to use any chemicals or pesticides that will affect the plants just as nature intended and keep the plants happy and healthy. We request our farmers only harvest the plants when they are ready to be harvested they also allow bees to collect the pollen so nature can produce more plants for us. We supply these flowers and plants to you with next day shipping and our stay alive guarantee where if you plant doesnâ€™t arrive alive we will issue a refund and a new plant completely free.</p>
